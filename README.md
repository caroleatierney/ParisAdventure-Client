# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


If you are cloning this, you need to run: npm install react-input-mask

I forgot to do this:

npx tailwindcss build
npm run build to create the DIST folder

Client and server are both started with npm run dev

Add?

Map/Location stuff
Make all titles text grow with the same size.
Select tag and add new... the same size
Make a panorama column so you can see more of it
Get arrows outside of itinerary carousel
Footer blurring itinerary
